Over the past decade Kazakhstan’s financial sector has undergone rapid digitalisation, and mortgage lending has emerged as one of the chief engines of household borrowing. In parallel, customers have developed new expectations: real time credit decisions, transparent amortisation tables, and mobile first self service tools that feel every bit as responsive as an in branch consultation. Astana Mortgage Center, hereafter the company, is positioning itself as a technology centric lender determined to shorten the customer’s “application to key” journey while remaining fully compliant with the National Bank of Kazakhstan’s increasingly data driven regulatory framework.
Against this backdrop, my industrial practice centred on designing, implementing, and integrating a REST based mortgage calculator microservice—a reusable backend component that can power the company’s public website, client portal, and internal CRM.

The architecture of the mortgage calculator system reflects modern best practices in modular web application development, comprising a clear separation between front-end presentation, back-end API logic, and core business computation. This architectural layout ensures maintainability, scalability, and ease of integration with external systems such as CRM platforms or public web portals.
